Spectral Decomposition as we described it, only applies for symmetric square matrices. Singular value decomposition can be thought of as a generalization to non symmetric and non square matrices.

Given a matrix $M \in \mathbb R^{m\times n}$ which corresponds to a linear transformation $L:\mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R^m$. We can define two square matrices $MM^t \in \mathbb R^{m \times m}, M^tM \in \mathbb R^{n \times n}$ corresponding to it.
