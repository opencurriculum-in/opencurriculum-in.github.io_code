<p style="font-size:1.4em; text-align: center; line-">Open Curriculum was born out of the belief that teaching/learning is a very delicate process. While it is easy to teach such that few brilliant students learn, it is really hard to make sure that no student is left behind. Content has to be carefully curated and presented in the language of the learner. Such level of detail requires continous improvement of course material which can only be achieved by an open source community which includes the teachers as well as the students themselves.</p>

The project was created by [Girish Varma](https://girishvarma.in), a faculty at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in/), as a means of continously improving his teaching material and curating resources from the web. While creating formatted notes for each topic is ideal, it is not necessarly meant to be like a textbook, but rather a curration of most relevant materials from the web, which will help the students understand each topic well. Currently it hosts videos, notes, problems and links to other resources on the web on a per lecture basis. It also allows anyone to make changes to the content easily in the browswer itself.
