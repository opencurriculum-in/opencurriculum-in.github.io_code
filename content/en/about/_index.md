<p style="font-size:1.4em; text-align: center; line-">Open Curriculum was born out of the belief that teaching/learning is a very delicate process. While it is easy to teach such that few brilliant students learn, it is really hard to make sure that no student is left behind. Content has to be carefully curated and presented in the language of the learner. Such level of detail requires continous improvement of course material which can only be achieved by an open source community which includes the teachers as well as the students themselves.</p>
