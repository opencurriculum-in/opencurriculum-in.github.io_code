This book is meant to be for Computer Science, Electronics Engineering, Applied Mathematics Students and Researchers. In the first two parts, it introduces most important topics in Linear Algebra in an abstract way, by using many proofs, helping the student to think like a mathematician first. In the thrid part, applications of the method to diverse fields are given. When teaching a course, it is suggested that some of the chapters in part III are interleaved with other parts to keep the students interested.  

The book makes use of the [Socratic Questioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning) method. For every topic, questions are asked to probe the reader in the direction of discovering the concepts.
